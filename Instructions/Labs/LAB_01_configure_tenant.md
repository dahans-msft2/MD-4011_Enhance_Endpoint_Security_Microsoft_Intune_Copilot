# Lab 01: Configure tenant for device management
# Student lab answer key

> **Abstract:**  
> In this lab, you will configure the foundational Microsoft Intune environment for Contoso Healthcare, including licensing, user accounts, permissions, and Entra ID settings to support device management. The scenario guides you through preparing the tenant for device enrollment by setting up automatic MDM enrollment, creating dynamic device groups, and verifying Intune tenant status.

## Lab scenario

In the labs for this course, you are taking on the role of **Deigo Sicilliani**, Contoso Healthcare's Modern Endpoint Administrator. Contoso Healthcare is a mid-sized healthcare organization that has deployed Microsoft 365 E5 and is now ready to implement modern endpoint management with Microsoft Intune.

You have been tasked with completing a pilot project that tests device management, security, and compliance features in Microsoft Intune as they relate to Contoso's healthcare industry requirements. The organization needs to ensure all endpoints are secure, compliant, and meet regulatory requirements while maintaining user productivity.

You have just started the pilot project. In this first lab, you will prepare the Microsoft 365 tenant for device management by verifying licenses, configuring Entra ID for automatic device enrollment, creating organizational groups, and validating Intune tenant readiness. These foundational configurations will enable device enrollment and policy management in subsequent labs.

## Lab Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 38 minutes

## Instructions

### Before You Begin - Administrative roles and zero-trust principles

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Zero-Trust and Least Privilege**: Following security best practices, you will assign specific administrative roles and use those throughout all labs rather than Global Administrator. This demonstrates proper role-based access control (RBAC) as recommended by Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> **Roles you will assign and use**:
> - **Intune Administrator**: For managing devices, policies, and apps in Intune
> - **Cloud Device Administrator**: For managing device settings in Entra ID
> - **Groups Administrator**: For creating and managing groups in Entra ID
> - **Conditional Access Administrator**: For creating conditional access policies (Lab 04)
> - **Security Administrator**: For Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and security baselines (Lab 05)
> 
> In Exercise 1, you will assign these roles to **Diego Siciliani** who will serve as the Intune administrator for all labs.

### WWL Tenants - Terms of Use

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are being provided with a tenant as a part of an instructor-led training delivery, please note that the tenant is made available for the purpose of supporting the hands-on labs in the instructor-led training.
> 
> Tenants should not be shared or used for purposes outside of hands-on labs. The tenant used in this course is a trial tenant and cannot be used or accessed after the class is over and is not eligible for extension.
> 
> Tenants must not be converted to a paid subscription. Tenants obtained as a part of this course remain the property of Microsoft Corporation and we reserve the right to obtain access and repossess at any time.
