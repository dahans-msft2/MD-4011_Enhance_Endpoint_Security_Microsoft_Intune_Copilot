    - **Users**: Select **All users** (or select specific pilot group)

    > [!TIP]
    > **Understanding Policy Exclusions**: While this lab applies the policy to all users, in production environments you may need to exclude certain service accounts such as Microsoft Teams Rooms devices, conference room resource accounts, or automated service principals that cannot support MFA or device compliance. Always document exclusions with business justification and review them regularly as part of your security posture management.

    **Target resources**:
    - **Select what this policy applies to**: Cloud apps
    - **Include**: Select **Select apps**
    - Search for and select: **Office 365 Exchange Online**

    **Conditions**:
    - **Device platforms**: Not configured (applies to all platforms)
    - **Client apps**: Not configured (applies to all apps)

    **Access controls**:
    - **Grant**: Select **Grant access**
    - Check the following:
        - **Require device to be marked as compliant**
        - **Require approved client app**

    **Enable policy**: Report-only (for initial testing)

1. Select **Create**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > "Report-only" mode allows you to test the policy without blocking users. You can review sign-in logs to see how the policy would behave before enforcing it.

You have successfully created a conditional access policy requiring compliant devices for Exchange Online access.

### Task 2 - Test conditional access policy in report-only mode

1. You are still in the **Microsoft Entra admin center** → **Protection** → **Conditional Access**.

1. Select **Insights and reporting** (or **Conditional Access Insights**).

1. Review the dashboard showing:
    - **Policies in report-only mode**: Your newly created policy
    - **Estimated impact**: Number of users affected

1. Wait 15-30 minutes for data to populate (or proceed to testing in Exercise 3).

1. After data is available, review the impact report to ensure the policy behaves as expected.

1. If satisfied, return to the policy and change **Enable policy** from **Report-only** to **On** to enforce it.

1. Leave the browser window open for the next exercise.

## Exercise 3: Test data protection and access control

### Exercise Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 5 minutes

In this exercise, you will test app protection policies on a mobile device and conditional access policies on a desktop device.

### Task 1 - Test app protection policy on mobile device (optional)

> [!NOTE]
> This task requires an iOS or Android device. If you don't have one, you can skip to Task 2.

1. On your **iOS or Android device**, install **Microsoft Outlook** from the App Store (iOS) or Play Store (Android).

1. Open the Outlook app.

1. Sign in with one of your **pilot user accounts** (e.g., AlexW@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com).

1. You should be prompted to **set up a PIN** (6 digits) as required by the app protection policy.

1. After setting the PIN, you are signed into Outlook and can view your email.

1. Try the following to test data protection:
    - **Screenshot**: Try to take a screenshot of an email → Should be blocked with a message: "Your organization doesn't allow screen captures"
    - **Copy/Paste**: Try to copy email text and paste into an unmanaged app (like Notes) → Should be blocked or show warning
    - **Print**: Try to print an email → Should be blocked
    - **Save attachment**: Try to save an email attachment → Should only allow saving to OneDrive for Business, not local storage

1. Close the Outlook app and reopen it after 30 minutes → You should be prompted to re-enter your PIN or use biometrics.

You have successfully tested the app protection policy on a mobile device.

### Task 2 - Test conditional access policy on compliant device (SEA-WS1)

1. On your **SEA-WS1** (corporate-owned, compliant device from Lab 03), open **Microsoft Edge**.

1. Navigate to **Outlook on the web**: [**https://outlook.office.com**](https://outlook.office.com).

1. Sign in with **Alex Wilber's** account (AlexW@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com).

1. Since SEA-WS1 is **compliant** (from Lab 03), you should be **granted access** to Outlook on the web.

1. Verify you can:
    - Read emails
    - Send emails
    - Access calendar and contacts

    > [!TIP]
    > This demonstrates that compliant devices can access corporate resources protected by conditional access.

1. Leave Outlook on the web open.

You have successfully accessed Outlook on a compliant device.

### Task 3 - Test conditional access policy on noncompliant device (SEA-WS2)

In this task, you will test the conditional access policy using SEA-WS2, which should be blocked if it's not compliant.

1. On your **SEA-WS2** (personal device), open **Microsoft Edge**.

1. Navigate to **Outlook on the web**: [**https://outlook.office.com**](https://outlook.office.com).

1. Sign in with **Allan Deyoung's** account (AllanD@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com).

1. If SEA-WS2 is **not compliant** (or not evaluated yet), you should see an error message:
    - "You can't get there from here"
    - "Your sign-in was successful, but your admin requires your device to be managed to access this resource"
    - "Your device must be managed by your organization to access this resource"
    - Option to enroll the device or contact your admin

    > [!NOTE]
    > If SEA-WS2 is compliant, access will be granted. To test the blocked scenario, you can temporarily make it noncompliant by disabling Windows Firewall or Defender on SEA-WS2, then syncing the device.

1. **Optional**: To force noncompliant state on SEA-WS2:
    - On SEA-WS2, open **Windows Security** → **Firewall & network protection**
    - Turn **off** the firewall for the active network profile
    - In the **Microsoft Intune admin center**, sync SEA-WS2 (Devices → All devices → SEA-WS2 → Sync)
    - Wait 5-10 minutes for compliance re-evaluation
    - Try accessing Outlook on the web again → Should now be blocked

1. **Restore compliance** (if you disabled firewall):
    - Re-enable Windows Firewall on SEA-WS2
    - Sync the device in Intune
    - Wait for compliance re-evaluation

You have successfully tested the conditional access policy on both compliant and noncompliant devices.

### Task 4 - Review sign-in logs for both devices

1. In the **Microsoft Entra admin center**, navigate to **Identity** → **Monitoring & health** → **Sign-in logs**.

1. Review recent sign-in events for both **Alex Wilber** and **Allan Deyoung**.

1. Select Alex Wilber's sign-in event (from SEA-WS1) to view details.

1. On the sign-in details page, select the **Conditional Access** tab.

1. Review the conditional access policy evaluation:
    - **Policy name**: Require compliant device for Exchange Online
    - **Result**: Success (device was compliant)
    - **Controls satisfied**: Require device to be marked as compliant ✅

1. Go back to the sign-in logs and select Allan Deyoung's sign-in event (from SEA-WS2).

1. On the sign-in details page, select the **Conditional Access** tab.

1. Review the policy evaluation:
    - **Policy name**: Require compliant device for Exchange Online
    - **Result**: Success (if compliant) or Failure (if noncompliant)
    - **Controls satisfied**: Require device to be marked as compliant (✅ or ❌)

1. Compare the two sign-in events to see how conditional access policies evaluate differently based on device compliance state.

    > [!TIP]
    > Sign-in logs are essential for troubleshooting conditional access policies. They show exactly why users are being granted or denied access, which policies applied, and which controls were evaluated.

You have successfully reviewed sign-in logs to understand conditional access policy enforcement across multiple devices.
