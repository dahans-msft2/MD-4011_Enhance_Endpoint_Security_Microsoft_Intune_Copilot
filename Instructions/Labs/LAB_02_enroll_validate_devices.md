# Lab 02: Enroll and validate devices
# Student lab answer key

> **Abstract:**  
> In this lab, you will enroll a Windows 11 device into Microsoft Intune using Entra join, validate the enrollment in both the Entra ID and Intune portals, and verify device properties, compliance status, and group membership. You will also perform device synchronization from both the portal and the device itself.

## Lab scenario

Continuing your role as **Diego Sicilliani**, Contoso Healthcare's Modern Endpoint Administrator, you have successfully configured the Microsoft 365 tenant for device management in Lab 01. Now you are ready to begin enrolling devices into Intune.

For the pilot project, you will enroll a Windows 11 device using Entra join, which provides seamless single sign-on and automatic Intune enrollment. After enrollment, you will validate the device appears in both Entra ID and Intune portals, review device properties and compliance status, and verify that the device was automatically added to the "All Windows Devices" dynamic group you created in Lab 01.

## Lab Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 30 minutes

## Instructions

### Before You Begin

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prerequisites**: You must complete **Lab 01: Configure tenant for device management** before starting this lab. Lab 01 configured automatic MDM enrollment, which is required for devices to enroll in Intune.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Administrative Account**: Continue using **Diego Siciliani's** account (DiegoS@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com) for all administrative tasks. In Lab 01, you assigned Diego the necessary roles (Intune Administrator, Cloud Device Administrator) and signed out of the Global Administrator account. Use Diego's account throughout this lab and all subsequent labs.

## Exercise 1: Enroll Windows device using Entra join

### Exercise Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you will join a Windows 11 device to Entra ID, which will automatically trigger MDM enrollment in Intune (thanks to the automatic enrollment configuration you completed in Lab 01).

### Task 1 - Join Windows device to Entra ID

In this task, you will connect your Windows device to your work or school account using Entra join.

1. On your **Windows 11 device**, open **Settings** by pressing **Windows key + I** (or right-click Start and select **Settings**).

1. In the Settings app, select **Accounts** from the left navigation pane.

1. Select **Access work or school**.

1. On the **Access work or school** page, you should see "No work or school accounts connected."

1. Select the **Connect** button.

1. On the **Set up a work or school account** window, enter **Alex Wilber's email address**: `AlexW@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com`

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Use Alex Wilber for the first device (SEA-WS1). You will use Allan Deyoung for the second device in Exercise 5.

1. Select **Next**.

1. You will be redirected to the Microsoft sign-in page. Enter the **password** for the user account.

1. If prompted, complete **multi-factor authentication** (MFA) if it is enabled for your tenant.

1. On the **You're all set!** screen, review the message:
    - "Your device has been joined to your organization's network."
    - "Your organization might control some settings and apps on this device."

1. Select **Done**.

1. You are returned to the **Access work or school** page. You should now see a connection listed:
    - **Connected to [Your Organization]'s Entra ID**
    - User account: **AlexW@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com**
    - Status: **Connected**

1. Below the connection, you may see an **Info** button. Select it to view connection details:
    - **Device state**: Entra ID joined
    - **Management**: Enrolled in MDM (Microsoft Intune)

    > [!NOTE]
    > If "Management" shows "Pending" or "Not enrolled," wait 1-2 minutes and refresh. Automatic MDM enrollment can take a moment to complete.

1. **Close** the Settings app.

    > [!TIP]
    > You may see a notification in the Windows taskbar: "Your organization is managing this device." This confirms Intune enrollment is active.

1. Leave the device powered on and connected to the internet.

You have successfully joined the Windows device to Entra ID and automatically enrolled it in Microsoft Intune.

> [!NOTE]
> This device will be referred to as **SEA-WS1** and is enrolled with **Alex Wilber's** account throughout the remaining labs.

## Exercise 4: Perform device synchronization

### Exercise Duration

  - **Estimated Time to complete**: 5 minutes

In this exercise, you will manually trigger device synchronization from both the Intune portal and the Windows device to force the device to check in with Intune immediately.

### Task 1 - Sync device from Intune portal

In this task, you will initiate a manual sync from the Intune admin center.

1. In the left navigation pane, expand **Devices** and select **All devices**.

1. Select **SEA-WS1** to open its device details page.

1. At the top of the device details page, locate the toolbar with device actions.

1. Select **Sync** (or the ellipsis **...** → **Sync** if the button is collapsed).

1. A confirmation message appears: **"Sync intiated."**

1. The device will receive a notification to check in with Intune immediately (instead of waiting for the scheduled 8-hour sync interval).

1. Note the **Last check-in** timestamp on the device overview page. After 1-2 minutes, refresh the page and the timestamp should update to show the recent sync.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Manual sync is useful for testing policy deployment or forcing immediate compliance evaluation.

1. Leave the browser window open for the next task.

You have successfully triggered a manual sync from the Intune admin center.

### Task 2 - Sync device from Windows Settings (optional)

In this task, you will initiate a sync from the Windows device itself.

1. On your **enrolled Windows 11 device**, open **Settings** (Windows key + I).

1. Select **Accounts** → **Access work or school**.

1. Select your work or school account connection (e.g., **Connected to [Your Organization]'s Azure AD**).

1. Select the **Info** button.

1. On the **Managed by [Your Organization]** page, scroll down to the **Device sync status** section.

1. Review the sync information:
    - **Last sync**: Timestamp of most recent sync
    - **Sync status**: Success or In progress

1. Select the **Sync** button.

1. A sync operation begins. You should see:
    - "Sync is in progress"
    - After 10-30 seconds: "Sync completed successfully"

1. The **Last sync** timestamp updates to show the current time.

1. Close the Settings app.

    > [!TIP]
