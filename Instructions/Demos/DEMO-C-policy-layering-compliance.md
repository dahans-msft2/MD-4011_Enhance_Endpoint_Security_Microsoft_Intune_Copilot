## Demo Summary

**Recap key steps**:
1. ✅ Created a configuration profile (Settings catalog) to enforce BitLocker encryption and security settings
2. ✅ Assigned configuration profile to dynamic group "All Windows Devices"
3. ✅ Created a compliance policy defining minimum security requirements (BitLocker, firewall, antivirus, password)
4. ✅ Configured actions for noncompliance (mark, email, retire)
5. ✅ Demonstrated filters for conditional policy targeting based on device properties
6. ✅ Validated policy deployment and compliance evaluation on enrolled device

**Key takeaways**:
- "Configuration profiles APPLY settings; compliance policies CHECK if settings meet requirements"
- "Dynamic groups enable automatic policy targeting without manual device assignment"
- "Filters provide additional targeting control beyond group membership"
- "Policy deployment is asynchronous - sync devices for immediate testing, but production deployments take hours"
- "Compliance status is the foundation for conditional access - noncompliant devices can be blocked"

**Transition to next module**:
"Now that we can apply policies and check compliance, we'll add data protection. In Module 4, we'll create app protection policies to prevent data leakage and conditional access policies to enforce device compliance before allowing resource access."

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: Policy shows "Pending" status for more than 15 minutes
**Cause**: Device hasn't synced, policy conflict, or deployment delay  
**Solution**: 
- Manually sync device: Device page → Sync button
- Wait up to 8 hours for automatic sync
- Check for conflicting policies with higher priority

### Issue: Device shows "Not compliant" but settings appear correct
**Cause**: Compliance evaluation hasn't run yet, or setting doesn't exactly match requirement  
**Solution**: 
- Wait 30 minutes for compliance evaluation
- Manually sync device to trigger evaluation
- Click into compliance policy details to see exactly which setting failed
- Verify setting value exactly matches requirement (e.g., password length)

### Issue: Cannot find BitLocker setting in Settings catalog
**Cause**: Wrong category or search term  
**Solution**: 
- Use Settings picker search: Type "BitLocker" or "encryption"
- Check under categories: Security → BitLocker
- Alternative: Use Templates → Endpoint protection template for pre-configured BitLocker settings

### Issue: Filter doesn't seem to apply to policy
**Cause**: Filter logic incorrect, or device doesn't match filter criteria  
**Solution**: 
- Verify device meets filter criteria (check device properties: ownership, OS version, etc.)
- Test filter logic: Filters → Select filter → Preview matching devices
- Check filter is applied to correct group in policy assignment (Include vs. Exclude)

### Issue: Configuration profile and compliance policy conflict
**Cause**: Configuration profile sets value, compliance policy requires different value  
**Solution**: 
- Ensure configuration profiles and compliance policies align
- Example: Config sets minimum password to 10, compliance requires 8 - device will be compliant but users experience 10-char requirement
- Best practice: Configuration requirements should meet or exceed compliance requirements

---

## Policy Precedence and Conflict Resolution

**Important concept to mention**:

When multiple policies apply to the same device:
1. **Most restrictive wins**: If Policy A requires 8-char password and Policy B requires 10-char, device gets 10-char requirement
2. **Last applied**: For non-security settings, most recently assigned policy takes precedence
3. **Explicit vs. not configured**: Explicit setting beats "not configured"

**Best practices**:
- Avoid overlapping policies that configure the same settings
- Use clear naming to indicate policy purpose and scope
- Document policy intent in descriptions
- Test policies on pilot groups before broad deployment
