## Demo Summary

**Recap key steps**:
1. ✅ Enrolled a Windows 11 device using work or school account connection
2. ✅ Verified device registration in Microsoft Entra ID (identity layer)
3. ✅ Validated device enrollment in Microsoft Intune (management layer)
4. ✅ Reviewed device properties, compliance status, and group memberships
5. ✅ Demonstrated manual device synchronization from portal and device

**Key takeaways**:
- "Device enrollment is a two-part process: Entra ID join (identity) + Intune enrollment (management)"
- "Automatic enrollment setting makes this seamless for users - one sign-in accomplishes both"
- "Devices appear in both Entra admin center and Intune admin center with linked information"
- "Group memberships (especially dynamic groups) determine which policies devices receive"

**Transition to next module**:
"Now that we have a managed device, we can start applying policies. In Module 3, we'll create configuration profiles and compliance policies to secure and configure this device."

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: "This device is already enrolled" error
**Cause**: Device was previously enrolled and not properly unenrolled  
**Solution**: 
- On device: Settings → Accounts → Access work or school → Select account → Disconnect
- In Intune: Delete the old device record
- Try enrollment again

### Issue: Device shows "Entra registered" instead of "Entra joined"
**Cause**: User chose "Set up for work or school" option instead of joining to Entra ID  
**Solution**: 
- Entra registered = BYOD/personal device (lighter management)
- Entra joined = corporate device (full management)
- To get full management, device needs to be Entra joined, not registered

### Issue: Device appears in Entra ID but not in Intune
**Cause**: Automatic MDM enrollment not configured or enrollment failed  
**Solution**: 
- Verify automatic enrollment is configured (Demo A, Part 2, Step 2.3)
- Check user has Intune license assigned
- Review enrollment status in Intune: Devices → Monitor → Enrollment failures

### Issue: Compliance shows "Not evaluated" or "In grace period"
**Cause**: No compliance policies assigned yet, or policies still deploying  
**Solution**: 
- This is normal for newly enrolled devices without compliance policies
- Assign a compliance policy (covered in Module 3)
- Wait 8-15 minutes for policy evaluation, or manually sync device

### Issue: "Last check-in" is more than 1 hour ago
**Cause**: Device sync issues or offline device  
**Solution**: 
- Verify device has internet connectivity
- Manually sync from device: Settings → Accounts → Info → Sync
- Check Intune service health: Intune admin center → Tenant administration → Service health

## Cleanup Steps

If demonstrating in a test environment and need to unenroll:

**From the device**:
1. Settings → Accounts → Access work or school
2. Select the connected work account
3. Click **Disconnect**
4. Confirm disconnection
5. Device will be removed from Entra ID and Intune

**From Intune admin center**:
1. Devices → All devices
2. Select the device
3. Click **Delete**
4. Confirm deletion

**Warning**: Disconnecting removes ALL corporate data, apps, and policies from the device. Don't do this on active user devices.
