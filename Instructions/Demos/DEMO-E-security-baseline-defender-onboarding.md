2. Sign in with Security Administrator credentials
3. Go to **Devices** → **Device inventory**
4. Look for the enrolled Windows device
5. Click on device to view:
   - Onboarding status: Active
   - Risk level: None/Low/Medium/High
   - Sensor health: Active
   - Last seen: Recent timestamp
   - Threat detections: Count of alerts

**Talking points**:
- "Device appears in Defender within 15 minutes of onboarding"
- "Active sensor health means telemetry is flowing properly"

2. Go to **Vulnerability management** → **Dashboard**
3. Review:
   - **Exposure score**: Organizational vulnerability level (0-1000, lower is better)
   - **Configuration score**: Security configuration effectiveness
   - **Top security recommendations**: Most impactful actions to improve security
4. Click **Recommendations**
5. Browse top recommendations:
   - Update Microsoft Office
   - Enable tamper protection
   - Configure controlled folder access
   - Turn on exploit protection

**Talking points**:
- "Defender continuously scans for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations"
- "Exposure score gives at-a-glance view of organizational risk"
- "Recommendations are prioritized by impact - fix high-impact issues first"
- "Recommendations link back to Intune policies for remediation"

**TODO**: Screenshot of Vulnerability Management dashboard

2. If alerts exist, select one to demonstrate:
   - Alert severity: Informational, Low, Medium, High
   - Alert story: Timeline of attack
   - Affected assets: Devices, users, files involved
   - MITRE ATT&CK techniques: Attack classification
3. Show recommended actions:
   - Isolate device
   - Run antivirus scan
   - Block file
   - Investigate user

**Talking points**:
- "Alerts are generated when suspicious activity is detected"
- "Each alert provides investigation context - what happened, when, which device"
- "MITRE ATT&CK mapping helps understand attacker techniques"
- "Recommended actions guide response - even for junior analysts"
- "In Module 6, we'll use Security Copilot to investigate alerts even faster"

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: Device doesn't appear in Defender portal after onboarding
**Cause**: Onboarding delay, network connectivity, or sensor not running  
**Solution**: 
- Wait 30 minutes for initial onboarding telemetry
- Verify device has internet connectivity to Defender cloud endpoints
- Check Defender services running: Settings → Privacy & Security → Windows Security → Virus & threat protection

### Issue: Security baseline fails to deploy to some devices
**Cause**: Conflicting policies, device offline, or OS version incompatibility  
**Solution**: 
- Check device compliance and last sync time
- Review baseline deployment status: Endpoint security → Security baselines → Select baseline → Monitor → Device status
- Resolve policy conflicts: If multiple policies configure same setting, most restrictive wins

### Issue: ASR rules block legitimate business applications
**Cause**: Application behavior triggers ASR rule (false positive)  
**Solution**: 
- Start with Audit mode to identify false positives before Block mode
- Create exclusions: Endpoint security → Attack surface reduction → Select policy → Properties → Exclusions
- Work with application vendor to modify app behavior if possible

### Issue: Exposure score is very high (> 500)
**Cause**: Many unpatched vulnerabilities, missing security configurations  
**Solution**: 
- Review top security recommendations and implement high-impact fixes first
- Deploy Windows Update policies to ensure devices receive security patches
- Remediate highest-severity vulnerabilities (CVE score > 7.0) immediately
