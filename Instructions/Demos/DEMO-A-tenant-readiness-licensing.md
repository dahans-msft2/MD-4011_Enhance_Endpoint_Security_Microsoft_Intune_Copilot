- Configure automatic MDM enrollment
- Verify tenant readiness for device onboarding

## Prerequisites

### Instructor Requirements
- Global Administrator or Intune Administrator role
- User Administrator role (for user/group management)
- Access to Microsoft 365 admin center and Entra admin center

### Environment Requirements
- Microsoft 365 tenant (E3, E5, or EMS E5)
- At least 2 test user accounts (one for device enrollment, one for admin)
- No existing Intune configuration (or ability to show configuration steps)

### Licenses Required
- Microsoft 365 E5, E3 + EMS E5, or standalone Intune licenses
- Licenses must be available for assignment (not all consumed)

## Demo Scenario

**Context**: You are Contoso Healthcare's IT administrator preparing the Microsoft 365 tenant for modern device management. Before enrolling devices, you need to ensure proper licensing, permissions, and automatic enrollment configuration.

**Narrative**: "Before we can start enrolling devices in Intune, we need to prepare our tenant. This involves three key steps: assigning the right licenses, setting up groups for device management, and configuring automatic MDM enrollment. Let's walk through each of these."

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Part 1: Verify and assign licenses (3-4 minutes)

#### Step 1.1: Check available licenses

**Action**: Navigate to Microsoft 365 admin center

1. Open browser and go to **https://admin.microsoft.com**
2. Sign in with Global Administrator credentials
3. In the left navigation, expand **Billing** → Select **Licenses**
4. Review the licenses available in your tenant

**Talking points**:
- "We need licenses that include Microsoft Intune for mobile device management"
- "E5 licenses include Intune, Defender for Endpoint, and Security Copilot capabilities"
- "E3 licenses need EMS E5 add-on for full security features"
- "Each device and user needs an appropriate license assigned"

**What to show**:
- Total licenses purchased vs. assigned
- License types available: Microsoft 365 E5, EMS E5, Intune Plan 1
- Identify which licenses include Intune (E5, EMS E5, standalone Intune)

**TODO**: Screenshot of Licenses page showing available license inventory

#### Step 1.2: Assign license to test user

**Action**: Assign Intune license to a test user

1. In Microsoft 365 admin center, navigate to **Users** → **Active users**
2. Search for and select a test user (e.g., "Alex Wilber" or your test user)
3. Click **Licenses and apps** tab
4. Check the box next to **Microsoft 365 E5** (or appropriate license)
5. Expand the license to view included services
6. Verify **Microsoft Intune** is checked under included services
7. Click **Save changes**

**Talking points**:
- "Users need licenses before they can enroll devices"
- "The Intune service must be enabled in the license - not all M365 licenses include it"
- "You can assign licenses individually or to groups for automation"
- "License assignment can take 5-15 minutes to propagate fully"

**What to show**:
- License assignment UI
- Specific Intune service toggle within the license
- Confirmation message after assignment

**TODO**: Screenshot of user license assignment showing Intune service enabled

#### Step 1.3: Verify Intune subscription is active

**Action**: Confirm Intune appears in tenant subscriptions

1. In Microsoft 365 admin center, go to **Billing** → **Your products**
2. Look for **Microsoft Intune** or **Enterprise Mobility + Security E5**
3. Click on the subscription to view details
4. Verify status shows as **Active**

**Talking points**:
- "This confirms Intune is provisioned and ready to use in our tenant"
- "If you don't see Intune here, licenses may not include it or need to be purchased separately"

**TODO**: Screenshot of subscriptions showing active Intune subscription

### Part 2: Configure Microsoft Entra ID for device management (4-5 minutes)

#### Step 2.1: Navigate to Entra admin center

**Action**: Switch to Microsoft Entra admin center

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to **https://entra.microsoft.com**
2. Sign in with the same admin credentials
3. In the left navigation, expand **Identity** → Select **Devices**
4. Select **Overview** to see current device enrollment state

**Talking points**:
- "Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) is the identity foundation for device management"
- "Devices join or register to Entra ID, then enroll in Intune for management"
- "We need to configure settings that allow device enrollment"

**What to show**:
- Devices overview page (likely shows zero devices if new tenant)
- Navigation structure of Entra admin center

**TODO**: Screenshot of Entra Devices overview page

#### Step 2.2: Configure device settings

**Action**: Set device enrollment permissions

1. In **Identity** → **Devices**, select **Device settings**
2. Review the following settings:
   - **Users may join devices to Azure AD**: Verify set to **All** or **Selected** (with appropriate groups)
   - **Users may register their devices with Azure AD**: Verify set to **All** or **Selected**
   - **Require Multi-Factor Authentication to register or join devices**: Note current setting (recommended: Enabled for production)
3. For demo purposes, ensure **All** is selected for both join and register options
4. Click **Save** if any changes were made

**Talking points**:
- "This controls which users can join devices to Entra ID"
- "In production, you might limit this to specific groups or require MFA"
- "For our demo, we'll allow all users so enrollment works smoothly"
- "Joining a device to Entra ID is the first step before Intune enrollment"

**What to show**:
- Device settings configuration options
- Explanation of "Join" (corporate-owned, fully managed) vs. "Register" (BYOD, lighter management)

**TODO**: Screenshot of Device settings page with options highlighted

#### Step 2.3: Configure automatic MDM enrollment

**Action**: Enable automatic enrollment into Intune

1. In **Identity** → **Devices**, select **Enroll** → **Automatic Enrollment**
2. Review **MDM user scope**:
   - If set to **None**: Change to **All** or **Some** (with selected groups)
   - If already configured: Review current scope
3. Select **All** for demo purposes
4. Review **MDM terms of use URL** (should auto-populate with Intune URL)
5. Leave **MAM user scope** as **None** (we'll configure MAM later)
6. Click **Save**

**Talking points**:
- "Automatic enrollment means when users join devices to Entra ID, they automatically enroll in Intune"
- "This eliminates a manual step and ensures devices are managed immediately"
- "MDM user scope controls who can auto-enroll - All users, specific groups, or none"
- "In enterprise scenarios, you might use groups to control enrollment by department or device ownership"

**What to show**:
- MDM user scope dropdown options
- Automatic enrollment settings
- Save confirmation

**Common issue**: If Intune doesn't appear as an MDM provider, go to **Identity** → **Devices** → **Enroll** → **Mobile Device Management** and add Microsoft Intune as the MDM authority.

**TODO**: Screenshot of Automatic Enrollment configuration with MDM scope set to All

### Part 3: Create groups for device management (3-4 minutes)

#### Step 3.1: Create a dynamic device group

**Action**: Create a dynamic group for Windows devices

1. In Entra admin center, navigate to **Groups** → **All groups**
2. Click **+ New group**
3. Configure the group:
   - **Group type**: Security
   - **Group name**: `All Windows Devices`
   - **Group description**: `Dynamic group containing all Windows devices managed by Intune`
   - **Membership type**: Dynamic Device
4. Click **Add dynamic query**
5. In the **Rule syntax** editor, enter this query:

```
(device.deviceOSType -eq "Windows")
```

6. Click **Save** to save the query
7. Click **Create** to create the group

**Talking points**:
- "Dynamic groups automatically populate based on device or user attributes"
- "This Windows devices group will auto-populate as we enroll Windows devices"
- "We'll use this group to target policies to all Windows devices later"
- "Dynamic groups update automatically - no manual membership management needed"

**What to show**:
- Group creation interface
- Dynamic query builder
- Query syntax for device OS type filtering

**TODO**: Screenshot of dynamic group creation with query visible

#### Step 3.2: Create a static test group

**Action**: Create a manual group for pilot testing

1. Click **+ New group** again
2. Configure the group:
   - **Group type**: Security
   - **Group name**: `Device Management Pilot Users`
   - **Group description**: `Users participating in the device management pilot`
   - **Membership type**: Assigned
3. Click **No members selected** under **Members**
4. Search for and select the test user you licensed earlier
5. Click **Select**
6. Click **Create**

**Talking points**:
- "Static (assigned) groups are useful for pilot deployments or special groups"
- "We'll use this pilot group to test policies on specific users before broad deployment"
- "Best practice: Start with pilot groups, validate, then expand to broader groups"
- "This mimics real-world deployment patterns - never deploy directly to all users"

**What to show**:
- Assigned membership group creation
- Member selection process
- Final group summary

**TODO**: Screenshot of assigned group with members selected

### Part 4: Verify Intune tenant status (1-2 minutes)

#### Step 4.1: Check Intune tenant connection

**Action**: Verify Intune admin center access

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to **https://intune.microsoft.com**
2. Sign in with the same admin credentials
3. Review the **Home** page dashboard
4. In the left navigation, go to **Tenant administration** → **Tenant status**
5. Review the following sections:
   - **Tenant details**: Verify tenant name and MDM authority (should show Microsoft Intune)
   - **Connector status**: Verify status (should be mostly empty in new tenant)
   - **Intune service health**: Check for any incidents or advisories

**Talking points**:
- "The Intune admin center is where we'll manage all device policies, apps, and compliance settings"
- "Tenant status confirms Intune is properly configured and connected to our Entra ID"
- "MDM authority should always show Microsoft Intune - if it shows something else, enrollment won't work"
- "Service health shows if Microsoft is experiencing any Intune service issues"

**What to show**:
- Intune admin center home dashboard
- Tenant status page with MDM authority highlighted
- Clean service health (or explain any current issues)

**TODO**: Screenshot of Intune tenant status page showing active status

## Demo Summary

**Recap key steps**:
1. ✅ Assigned appropriate licenses (M365 E5 or Intune licenses) to test users
2. ✅ Configured Entra ID device settings to allow device joining and registration
3. ✅ Enabled automatic MDM enrollment so devices enroll in Intune automatically
4. ✅ Created dynamic and static groups for device targeting and policy assignment
5. ✅ Verified Intune tenant status and MDM authority

**Key takeaways**:
- "Licensing is the foundation - users need licenses before devices can enroll"
- "Automatic enrollment eliminates manual steps and ensures compliance"
- "Groups enable targeted policy deployment and phased rollouts"
- "Always verify tenant readiness before enrolling devices"

**Transition to next module**:
"Now that our tenant is ready, we can start enrolling devices. In Module 2, we'll walk through enrolling a Windows device and validating it appears in both Entra ID and Intune."

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Intune doesn't appear in license services"
**Cause**: License SKU doesn't include Intune  
**Solution**: Verify you're using E5, EMS E5, or standalone Intune licenses. E3 alone doesn't include Intune.

### Issue: "Cannot enable automatic MDM enrollment"
**Cause**: Intune MDM authority not configured  
**Solution**: Navigate to **Entra admin center** → **Devices** → **Enroll** → **Mobile Device Management** and add Microsoft Intune.

### Issue: "Dynamic group query doesn't work"
**Cause**: Syntax error in query  
**Solution**: Use the query builder UI instead of manual entry. Verify property names exactly match Microsoft documentation.

### Issue: "User license assignment not showing immediately"
**Cause**: License propagation delay  
**Solution**: Wait 15-30 minutes for license changes to propagate across services. Check M365 admin center → Users → Licenses to confirm assignment.

## Cleanup Steps

If demonstrating in a production-like environment and need to reset:

1. **Remove test user licenses**: Go to M365 admin center → Users → Select user → Licenses tab → Uncheck licenses
2. **Delete test groups**: Go to Entra admin center → Groups → Select group → Delete
3. **Reset MDM enrollment scope**: Go to Entra admin center → Devices → Enroll → Automatic Enrollment → Set to None

**Warning**: Do NOT clean up in a live tenant being used for actual device management.
